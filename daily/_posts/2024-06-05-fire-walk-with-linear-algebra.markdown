A little unfocused today. Did some research into math prerequisites for understanding DSP concepts.

I'm starting to work on Linear Algebra, which should hopefully come in useful for DSP. If not that, it will help me with 3D graphics when I start going back down that rabbit hole again. I watched a few videos from 3Blue1Brown's [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) video series. I really love these, seems like a great way to get a good mental model of LA before (and after) working through textbooks.

It seems that other topics like Discrete Mathematics and Real Analysis may play into DSP as well, but it's difficult to get a straight answer when trying to find a good study path. I feel like I'm trying to thread the needle of getting the correct mathematical grounding without taking on a bachelors-degree-level mathematics curriculum. I suppose I'll follow my interests and see where that leads me.

In the evening, I watched a fan edit of Fire Walk With Me at a friend's house. It's been a very long time since I've seen it, but the inclusion of a significant amount of cut content really fleshed out the mythos/psychology of Laura Palmer. A good bit more of Twin Peaks Kitsch worked its way in as well. I think this will kick off another pass through the series.
